		<h2 style="color:white; text-decoration:underline"> OVERVIEW </h2>
		<p style="color:white; font-size:20px; font-weight:bold">A pattern is a series or a sequence that repeats itself. Patterns in JavaScript are essential to practice as they give us a better understanding of loops and nested loops.

Programmers who practice patterns in JavaScript tend to think of the flow of the program faster than other programmers who do not.</p>

		<h2 style="color:white; text-decoration:underline"> INTRODUCTION </h2>
		<p style="color:white; font-size:20px; font-weight:bold">A pattern is a series or a sequence that repeats itself. Patterns are the most common programs practiced while learning the basics of JavaScript. They improve logical thinking and help us quickly figure out the programâ€™s execution flow (especially loops) with practice.

Many people skip this step as they think patterns are easy and a waste of time to practice, but patterns can significantly help you think about a problem and reach the solution in less time.</p>

		<h2 style="color:white; text-decoration:underline"> Why Use Patterns? </h2>
		<p style="color:white; font-size:20px; font-weight:bold">Most of the time, patterns are not directly used while developing applications using JavaScript. Still, it is advised to practice patterns before jumping to the advanced topics of JavaScript so that the basic programmer has adequate knowledge of the flow of the programs and how loops work before jumping to higher concepts of JavaScript.

A good practice of pattern in JavaScript helps improve problem-solving skills and logical thinking.</p>
